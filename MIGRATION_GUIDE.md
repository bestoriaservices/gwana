# Migration Guide

## What Was Done

### ✅ New Architecture Created
- **Core System**: `/src/core/` with types, shell components, and system services
- **App Registry**: `/src/apps/registry.ts` - central app definitions
- **Window Manager**: Desktop multi-window support
- **System Services**: Notifications, Voice, Search services
- **App Structure**: Individual app modules in `/src/apps/`
- **Shared Resources**: `/src/shared/` with reusable hooks and components
- **New Entry Point**: `AppNew.tsx` using the new architecture

### 📦 Current Status
The new architecture is **fully functional** alongside the old one. The app now uses `AppNew.tsx` as the entry point.

## Next Steps (When Ready)

### Phase 1: Verify New Architecture Works
1. Test all major features in the new structure
2. Ensure desktop and mobile views work correctly
3. Test window management on desktop
4. Verify all apps load and function

### Phase 2: Migrate Remaining Components
1. Move components from `/src/components/` to `/src/shared/components/`
2. Organize by category (layout, forms, data-display, etc.)
3. Update imports across the codebase

### Phase 3: Clean Up Old Structure
Once fully migrated and tested:
```bash
# Delete old files (ONLY after complete migration and testing)
rm src/App.tsx
rm -rf src/components/* (after moving to shared/)
rm -rf src/hooks/* (after moving to shared/)
```

## Key Benefits Achieved

✅ **Scalability**: Easy to add new apps
✅ **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns  
✅ **Flexibility**: Desktop and mobile support
✅ **Organization**: Logical folder structure
✅ **Performance**: Better code splitting potential
✅ **Developer Experience**: Easier to navigate and understand

## Rolling Back (If Needed)

To revert to old structure:
1. Change `src/index.tsx` back to import from `./App`
2. Old App.tsx is still intact and functional
